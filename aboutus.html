        We are Coffee Bears and our passion is coffee. We aim to make the perfect blend of find coffee and serve it in a creative community space.

        It all started with a desire to create a space for creative people to gather. The meeting place of like- minded people amidst art galleries, bookshops and pubs. Shania began to meet students in local coffee shops and found herself discussing premium coffee roasting and brewing. With this blooming interest and passion, a vision for This Coffee Place was born.
            
        Her enthusiasm is infectious to both customers and staff. This has led This Coffee Place down the path of handcrafted coffee and a new space opening in Torontoâ€™s trendy East Riverdale district.
