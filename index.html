        Our farmer partners are hardworking and many have been affected by years of military conflict. The sale our coffee supports the people of this impoverished area. We rely on the skilled effort of the farmers. To honour this effort, we are constantly expanding our Direct Trade Model. Through this model, we ensure that all of the premium prices we pay benefit the farmers.
        
        In addition to giving back to the community, it also provides a coffee that is good for your health. It calls this new coffee “acid-free coffee.” It is a new concept in the coffee industry, founded on a unique “Z- Roasting” computerized process that roasts beans for the optimal amount of time. Acid-free coffee is safer for tooth enamel and gentler on the stomach. It also has been known to provide relief for some stomach problems such as heartburn.
